# Push a transformer to Hugging Face

I [vibe trained](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?lang=en) a one-layer GPT-2 on [Tiny Shakespeare](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karpathy/char-rnn/master/data/tinyshakespeare/input.txt) and pushed the model to Hugging Face. Download it [here](https://huggingface.co/ishanjmukherjee/tiny-shakespeare-gpt1l). 

After training the model, I downloaded the model from HF, and did some inference on it. It turns out that Hugging Face's APIs are exceptional in masking all the grunt work that goes into training, uploading and running a model!
